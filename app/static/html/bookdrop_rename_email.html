  Dear reader,
</p>

<p>
  As of today, due to trademark reasons, the Kindlebox service has been
  renamed to BookDrop. From now on, kindlebox.me is obsolete. If you need
  to stop syncing your Dropbox folder or update your active Kindle devices,
  please visit the new site, <b>getbookdrop.com</b>.
</p>
<p>
  What does that mean for you? Not much. You can continue using BookDrop by
  adding books to Dropbox/Apps/kindle-box. Users who register after today will
  have the folder Dropbox/apps/book-drop.
</p>
<p>
  Thanks for your continued support, and happy reading!
</p>
