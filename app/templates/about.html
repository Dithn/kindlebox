    <b>How does Kindlebox work?</b>
    <p>
      Kindlebox works on top of Amazon's existing
      <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=200767340">Kindle Personal Documents Service</a>. Through
      this service, you can give certain email addresses permission to send
      documents to your Kindle, free of charge. Your Kindle can then download
      these documents wirelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever you add a book to <code>Dropbox/Apps/kindle-box</code>, Kindlebox
      is notified by
      <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/developers/webhooks">Dropbox</a>.
      Kindlebox then downloads the book through
      <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core">Dropbox</a>
      and emails it to your Kindle.

      What kind of files can I send using Kindlebox?
    </b>
    <p>
      You can send any files supported by <a
        href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200767340">Amazon</a>.
      These are:
      <ul>
        <li>.mobi, .pdf, .azw</li>
        <li>.txt, .rtf, .doc, .docx, .htm, .html</li>
        <li>.gif, .png, .bmp, .jpg, .jpeg</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <b>Can I delete books from my Kindle using Kindlebox?</b>
    <p>
    Unfortunately, no. We'll have to wait for a Kindle API :(

      I have some books that I've already transferred to my Kindle. If I add
      them to my Kindlebox folder, will they get added to my Kindle again?
    </b>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, yes. This is because Kindlebox has no way of knowing what
      files are already on your Kindle.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a way around this, though.  Kindlebox will only send files of a
      certain type, so if you rename a file with an unsupported file extension
      (e.g. ".kbox"), it won't get sent to your Kindle. Make sure to do this
      <i>before</i> you add the file to your Kindlebox folder.

    <b>What kinds of reading devices can I use Kindlebox with?</b>

      What does the "Activate Kindlebox" bookmarklet do? Should I be worried
      about running this JavaScript in my browser?
    </b>
    <p>
      The bookmarklet does a couple things. First, it scrapes the Amazon
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/mn/dcw/myx.html">Manage Your Content and Devices</a>
      page for possible Kindlebox devices and displays them in a modal for you to
      pick from. Second, the bookmarklet sends a request to Amazon to allow a
      Kindlebox email address to send your Kindle devices personal documents. If
      all goes well, the bookmarklet notifies Kindlebox that your account is all
      set.
