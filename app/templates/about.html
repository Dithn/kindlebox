      What is Kindlebox?
    </b>
    <p>
      Kindlebox is an easy way to transfer books to your Kindle using a Dropbox
      folder.

      How do I use Kindlebox?
    </b>
    <p>
      It's simple! Just <a href="{{ url_for('home') }}?redirect=true">register
      here</a>, and start adding books to your
      <code>Dropbox/Apps/kindle-box</code> folder. Any new books you add will
      get sent to your Kindle.
    </p>

      Can I use Kindlebox to share books with friends?
    </b>
    <p>
      Yup, just follow these steps:
      <ol>
        <li>Create a folder for books in your <code>Dropbox</code> folder.</li>
        <li>Go to the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox website</a>,
        and share the folder with a friend.</li>
        <li>Using a file manager like "Finder" on Mac OS, create a shortcut to
        the shared folder inside <code>Dropbox/Apps/kindle-box</code>.</li>
        <li>Have your friend create a similar shortcut to their copy of the
        shared folder. Now you'll both receive any books that get added to the
        folder!</li>
      </ol>

    <b>What kind of reading devices can I use Kindlebox with?</b>
    <p>
    You can use Kindlebox with any Kindle e-reader or mobile app.

  <li class="faq-li">
    <b>
      What kind of files can I send using Kindlebox?
    </b>
    <p>
      You can send any files supported by <a
        href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200767340">Amazon</a>,
      in addition to <b>.epub</b>, which Kindlebox will convert to a
      Kindle-supported format. In total, these are:
      <ul>
        <li>.epub, .mobi, .pdf, .azw</li>
        <li>.txt, .rtf, .doc, .docx, .htm, .html</li>
        <li>.gif, .png, .bmp, .jpg, .jpeg</li>

    <b>
        Help! I've added books to my Kindlebox folder, but I haven't received
        them on my Kindle for some reason.
    </b>
    <p>
        First things first, make sure your Kindle is connected to WiFi, and
        wait a few minutes. Because Kindlebox depends on Internet connections
        to both Dropbox and Amazon, there could be a slight delay in receiving
        your books.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you still haven't received the file, make sure that it's of one of
        the supported filetypes listed above and that it's below 15MB. If all
        else fails, <a href="mailto:swang93@mit.edu">send us an
        email</a> detailing what happened.
    </p>

  <li class="faq-li">
    <b>Can I delete books from my Kindle using Kindlebox?</b>
    <p>
    Unfortunately, no. We'll have to wait for a Kindle API :(
    </p>
  </li>

  <li class="faq-li">
    <b>
      I have some books that I've already transferred to my Kindle. If I add
      them to my Kindlebox folder, will they get added to my Kindle again?
    </b>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, yes. This is because Kindlebox has no way of knowing what
      files are already on your Kindle.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a way around this, though.  Kindlebox will only send files of a
      certain type, so if you rename a file with an unsupported file extension
      (e.g. ".kbox"), it won't get sent to your Kindle. Make sure to do this
      <i>before</i> you add the file to your Kindlebox folder.

      Can I register for Kindlebox on mobile?
    </b>
    <p>
      Nope :( Perhaps in a galaxy far far away...

  <li class="faq-li">
    <b>
      Can I connect multiple Dropbox accounts to the same Kindle?
    </b>
    <p>
      Yup, just make sure to register your different Dropbox accounts with the
      same Kindle. You can also connect multiple Kindles to the same Dropbox
      account, as long as they all belong to the same Amazon account.
    </p>

    <b>How does Kindlebox work under the hood?</b>
    <p>
      Kindlebox works on top of Amazon's existing
      <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=200767340">Kindle Personal Documents Service</a>. Through
      this service, you can give certain email addresses permission to send
      documents to your Kindle, free of charge. Your Kindle can then download
      these documents wirelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever you add a book to <code>Dropbox/Apps/kindle-box</code>, Kindlebox
      is notified by the
      <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/developers/webhooks">Dropbox webhooks service</a>.
      Kindlebox then downloads the book through the
      <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core">Dropbox Core API</a>
      and emails it to your Kindle.
    </p>

  <li class="faq-li">
    <b>
      What does the "Activate Kindlebox" bookmarklet do? Should I be worried
      about running this JavaScript in my browser?
    </b>
    <p>
      The bookmarklet does a couple things. First, it scrapes the Amazon
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/mn/dcw/myx.html">Manage Your Content and Devices</a>
      page for possible Kindlebox devices and displays them in a modal for you to
      pick from. Second, the bookmarklet sends a request to Amazon to allow a
      Kindlebox email address to send your Kindle devices personal documents. If
      all goes well, the bookmarklet notifies Kindlebox that your account is all
      set.
